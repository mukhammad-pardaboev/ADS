# Frequency Counter Pattern

This pattern is used to solve problems where you need to count the frequency of elements in a collection, such as characters in a string or numbers in an array. It is particularly useful for problems involving anagrams, duplicates, or any situation where the frequency of elements matters.

This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) time complexity solutions, allowing for more efficient O(n) solutions.
